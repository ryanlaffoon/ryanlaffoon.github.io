I had to double-check the address when I arrived. I remember calling my girlfriend, confused.

"It's a house, in the middle of a residential neighborhood - They didn't say anything about this!"

On a an unmarked intersection in Coeur d'Alene, a two-story house stood in a yard I was fairly certain would contain some type of office housing a software development shop. I definitely was taken off-guard.

My confusion would be compounded after knocking on the door, when a shaggy man would answer the door not knowing what company or interview I was talking about. Of course, he was only joking.
