I make the 45+ minute drive from my home to the "office" on a cool summer morning. I enter the house & get acquainted with all of the faces that I'd met in the interview. Mention is made of the previous developer whom I'd replaced, and his sudden disappearance. "I actually didn't know him that well" I reflect, hoping not to catch some associative guilt.

At some point it sinks in that this will be my first job outside of college and in the professional world...

I'm introduced to the history of the home (formerly the family home of the owners), my desk and my first project.

The boss brings down a crumbling COBOL book and slaps it down on my desk...
