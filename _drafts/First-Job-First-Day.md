I make the 45+ minute drive from my home to the "office" on a cool summer morning. I enter the house & get acquainted with all of the faces that I'd met in the interview, trying to hide my nerves. Mention is made of the previous developer whom I'd replaced, and details surrounding his sudden disappearance. 

> "I actually didn't know him that well" 

I reflect, hoping not to catch some associative guilt.

At some point it sinks in that this will be my first job outside of college and in the professional world...

I'm introduced to the history of the home/office (formerly the family home of the owners), my first desk and my first project.

After I've set up, the boss comes downstairs  holding an ancient COBOL book and with a smile, gently sets it on my desk...
