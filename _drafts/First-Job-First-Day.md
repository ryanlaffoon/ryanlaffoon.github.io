I make the 45+ minute drive from my home to the "office" on a cool summer morning. I enter the house & get acquainted with all of the faces that I'd met in the interview. Mention is made of the previous developer whom I'd replaced, and his sudden disappearance. "I actually didn't know him that well" I reflect, hoping not to catch some associative guilt.
