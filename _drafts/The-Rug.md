Full Circle.
I knew something was up when I heard Cliff open his door and start down the hall. 
When he stopped at my desk to make conversation, it felt so out of place that my heart started to drop before I knew what was happening.
Somehow, I knew that it was coming despite never experiencing such a thing - It was something that just happened from time to time in the industry, I should know that.
Nothing could soften the blow, but I remained stone-faced as the news came. 
Not as much success from the business core these days meant that numbers would not match up to expectations, and in such a small organization cuts would have to be made.
The owner had reduced his own pay to cover the costs of operating, but it wasn't enough. Unfortunately, my position was no longer viable and had to be eliminiated.

On the plus side, there just happened to be a former employee of Cliff working a few blocks away, who just so happened to need a new developer...
