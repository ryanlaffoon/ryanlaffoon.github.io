The pictures are still online...

The first company picnic was pretty cool, I got the chance to bring my family out to enjoy swimming in the river, playing softball and barbecue.

Following the picnic, we would regularly barbecue through the summer afternoons - Brian taking our orders at a quarter to noon, then donning sunglasses and sipping soda on the deck in the sun. 
A sense of family was starting to form, and I felt like I could begin to make a career out of this.

Until they had to let one of us go...
