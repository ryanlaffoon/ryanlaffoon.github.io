I had to double-check the address when I arrived. I remember calling my girlfriend at the time, confused.

> "It's a house, in the middle of a residential neighborhood - They didn't say anything about this!"

On an unmarked intersection in Coeur d'Alene, a two-story house stood in a yard I was fairly certain would contain some type of office building and software development shop. I definitely was taken off-guard.

My confusion would be compounded after knocking on the door, when a shaggy man in a T-shirt would answer the door with a yawn and a confused look.

> "What interview?"

Joking aside, I was invited inside to sit in the "living room", while the team peppered me with an assortment of questions. The barrage was difficult but manageable, and I was comfortable with my answers in the end.



Favorite interview question: 
"What does the COALESCE keyword do in SQL?"
