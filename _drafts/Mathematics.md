I was pretty decent at math in High school - In fact, I remember being among the youngest in the AP classes for my last three years of high-school, which I finished with a successful Pre-Calculus course.
Entering college was a different story however, and my first attempt at college level math following the next inevitable step was a Calculus course which I would drop on the first day. I then downgraded to Trigenometry and worked my way back up through the college system. I would fail or drop 3 Calculus courses in total until I re-took the subject again after a year with the chair of the mathematics department of YVCC & committing to a daily ritual of study at the "Math Lab", also helping a foreign classmate who shared my struggle. This routine would see my average math grades increase substantially, and was my first real hint at the power of preparation.
