I was pretty decent at math in High school - In fact, I remember being among the youngest in the AP classes for my last three years of high-school, which I finished with a successful Pre-Calculus course.
Entering college was a different story however, and my first attempt at college level math following the next inevitable step was a Calculus course which I would drop on the first day. I would then downgrade to Trigenometry and work my way back up for a few quarters. I would fail or drop 3 Calculus courses in total until things finally clicked. I re-took the subject again after a year with the chair of the mathematics department and committed myself to daily ritual of study at the college Math Lab while helping a Peruvian classmate who shared my struggle. This routine would see my average math grades increase substantially, and was my hint at the power of self-preparation.

I left YVCC having completed all of the primary Calculus series with an increasing grade, though I often wish that the past me posessed a better tenacity to pursue the challenge, as I could have eliminated a lot of repetition throughout my education.
