I first met Brian Looyenga at the Job Fair in my final quarter at Eastern. I remember reading up on Fluent Edge from the fair attendance flyer, but they frankly weren't at the top of my list to visit that day. I recognized another developer on their team which graduated the year before and with whom I had worked on a class project, so there was at least a connection there. Every student attending seemed to want the attention of the new game development company recruiter near the entrance, including me - I'd even been first in line. I would later interview with that company unsuccessfully, my first taste of interviewing in the tech industry outside of The Internship.

I would meander through two floors of company exhibits and dozens of conversations with representatives - the standard handshakes, introductions and form questions - before stopping at a seemingly ignored Fluent Edge exhibit and bored Brian. His face lit up as we discussed the fair, his company & role - I think I even recalled and mentioned Ecometry (A platform they support) during our conversation. In the end, I felt that our meeting was successful, despite Brian's musing that there wouldn't necessarily be a position available until there was a project & funding in place to support it. Regardless, I gave them my resume & promised to be in touch.

I must have annoyed him to death, how often I called in the next few weeks. I'm certain it did, actually - he told me himself. I was reasonable-ish about it, but persistant just the same. In any case, I doggedly persisted the job (While continuing to look elsewhere, of course), and got the call in late May, 2010 while standing outside of my son's elementary school during pickup. My persistant calling had kept my name in the air, and the developer which I had recognized earlier had apparently quit without notice - My opening had arrived!

I had a phone interview with Brian and his father Cliff later in the week during a rainstorm, pacing around my living room with the windows cracked, excitedly rambling through my school achievements & detailing my internship work. The excitement was shared, and I would visit their office in person the following week.
