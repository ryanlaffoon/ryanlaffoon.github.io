So, I Finally got around to putting a portfolio site together! I suppose you could say it's better late than never, and I would definitely agree, but I've been frankly wondering what took me so long to get started. 

The impetus for this has definitely been centered around my recent experiences with unemployment & that wonderful question...

>"What have you been working on lately?"

_The answer is right here, friend._

I always wanted to set up an interactive website and blog for my professional & personal pursuits, but I had never taken the steps to accomplish that goal - I felt overwhelmed and didn't how to go about starting such an endeavor (Obligatory Plug: Thank you, Github Pages!). Now that I've laid the foundation, **I genuinely feel more excitement about developing software, building experiences and advancing my career than I ever have before.** I look forward to continuing the journey, fleshing out this site & sharing my experiences. 

I *sincerely* hope that I can carry this excitement with me to my next opportunity, continue to grow and improve as a developer & human, and create some impact on the world at large. The work never stops.

Until next time!
