I first met Brian at the Job Fair in my final quarter at Eastern. I remember reading up on Fluent Edge from the fair attendance flyer, but they frankly weren't at the top of my list to visit that day. I recognized another developer on their team which graduated the year before and with whom I had worked on a class project, so there was at least a connection there. Every student attending seemed to want the attention of the new game development company recruiter near the entrance, including me - I'd even been first in line. I would later interview with that company unsuccessfully, my first taste of interviewing in the tech industry outside of The Internship.

I would meander through two floors of company exhibits and dozens of conversations with representatives - the standard handshakes, introductions and form questions - before stopping at a seemingly ignored Fluent Edge exhibit and bored Brian. His face lit up as we discussed the fair, his company & role - I even mentioned their support of the Ecometry platform during our conversation. In the end, I felt that our meeting was successful, despite Brian's musing that there wouldn't necessarily be a position available until there was a project & funding in place to support it. Regardless, I gave them my resume & promised to be in touch.

I had a phone interview with Brian and his father Cliff later in the week during a rainstorm, pacing circles around my living room with the windows cracked, excitedly rambling through memories of school & internship work. The excitement I had was shared, and I would be invited to visit their office in person the following week.
