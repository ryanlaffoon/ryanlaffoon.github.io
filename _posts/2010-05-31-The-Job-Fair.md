I met my first boss at a Job Fair/Career Expo during my final quarter at Eastern. I remember reading up on Fluent Edge from the attendance flyer, but they weren't at the top of my list to visit that day. Digging through pictures on their website, I recognized a member of their team who I had worked with on a class project, so there was at least a connection there. Every CS student attending seemed to want the attention of the new game development company recruiter near the entrance, including me - I'd even been first in line. I would later interview with that company unsuccessfully, my first taste of interviewing in the tech industry outside of my internship from the previous quarter.

I found myself meandering through two floors of company exhibits, conducting dozens of conversations with representatives - complete with the standard handshakes, introductions and form questions - before stopping at a seemingly ignored Fluent Edge exhibit and a bored Brian. His face lit up as we discussed the fair, his company & role - I even mentioned their support of the Ecometry platform during our conversation. In the end, I felt that our meeting was successful, despite Brian's musing that there wouldn't necessarily be a position available yet. Regardless, I gave them what I could muster for a resume & promised to be in touch.

I had a phone interview with Brian and his father Cliff later in the week during a rainstorm, pacing circles around my living room with the windows cracked, excitedly rambling through memories of school & internship work. The excitement I had was shared, and I would be invited to visit their office in person the following week...
