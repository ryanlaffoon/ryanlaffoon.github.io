    For a long time, I’ve been wanting to construct a portfolio site and blog to highlight my achievements, connect with other great mentors, stand out among my peers & ensure my career growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to be honest about it though, and share the reality of working in the industry from my personal perspective. I wanted to explain myself technically, but paint a picture with my personality. That’s the point of a blog, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    After several tumultuous years of developing software & creating experiences with a diverse array of technology teams, I found myself with an opportunity to reflect on those experiences and share them.

    As I have never been a blogger, most of these stories are still in transition from my head to a digital medium. As they become more complete posts, I will include links and they will be accessible from here and the Notes menu.

    To Note - This collection of stories pertains to my time working for a private employer. I have taken means to be as prudent as possible in avoiding subjects which tread on non-disclosure agreements or include inappropriate content. Opinions and wit, however, have adeptly been left intact.

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
